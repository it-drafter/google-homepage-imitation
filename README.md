# Google Homepage Imitation

Google homepage made in HTML, CSS and a touch of JavaScript. I also used a couple of Font Awesome icons.

To make things interesting, I did it the 'old school' CSS way - by using only relative, absolute and fixed positioning. No flexbox or grid layout models whatsoever.


## Demo

You can see what it looks like [HERE](http://drafter.atwebpages.com/google-homepage-imitation/).

Buttons and links don't do anything. That's how you'll know for sure that it is not real Google.


## Run Locally

Download .zip with all included files and folders, or clone the project:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/it-drafter/google-homepage-imitation.git
```

To see the page, simply run the index.html file in your favourite browser.

No installation needed.
